# tweeter-to-bigquery-stream
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ngosavi-26
- Having worked extensively on creating batch processing data pipelines
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring data pipelines streaming real-time data into bigquery[GCP]
This data pipeline would stream realtime tweets from Twitter api and load into biquery through pubsub using Apache beam pipeline running on GCP dataflow
